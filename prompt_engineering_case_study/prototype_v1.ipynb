It was one of the most highly-anticipated releases of the year, and although people were frustrated when its release got delayed more than once, I think they understood that COVID was causing trouble for everyone and hopeful that a delay would mean a very polished game. But then the release approached and news came out that, despite earlier promises that developers wouldn’t be required to deal with “crunch time,” they had to deal with it for more than a year.', metadata={'source': 'review_01'}), Document(page_content='Bottom Line\\nCyberpunk 2077 is a heck of a game, if you can manage to play it.\\n\\nGraphics\\n85\\nSound\\n90\\nGameplay\\n90\\nControl\\n80\\nStory\\n95\\nOverall Score\\n70', metadata={'source': 'review_01'}), Document(page_content='In Cyberpunk 2077, you play a character known only as V who takes a page from the Dragon Age: Origins book and starts in one of three places of your choice. After a short prologue, all three stories converge in the same area, but you have dialogue options related to your specific backstory throughout the game. The main story deals with a question at the heart of the cyberpunk genre: what does it mean to be human? It’s a difficult question, and I don’t know that this game attempts to give a definitive answer so much as it tells one person’s struggle to decide what it means to them and what they feel is justifiable in the pursuit of holding onto their humanity and defining a legacy for themselves.', metadata={'source': 'review_01'}), Document(page_content='As long as things aren’t glitchy, it’s extremely interesting to walk and drive around Night City seeing everything that’s on display. The various sectors of the city have their similarities, but they are mostly distinct, from the types of buildings and roads to the people walking around. Head to the edges of town and you can find the mansions of the elite or the nasty, nasty garbage dump and oil field. The business district is shiny and clean, without the vending machines present all over the residential areas. I finished the game’s story yesterday, but I’ll definitely be back to find more of what I haven’t seen yet.', metadata={'source': 'review_01'})]\n",

    "##### Gameplay\n",
    "According to John Tucker's review, the gameplay of Cyberpunk 2077 is excellent and allows players to choose their own approach to completing objectives.

    "\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Performance\n",
    "According to John Tucker's review, the performance of Cyberpunk 2077 on console versions was \"so buggy as to be unplayable,\" with digital and physical retailers expanding their refund policies to accommodate anyone who wanted to return the game. However, in his personal experience, he was able to play all the way to the end credits with only minor glitches on PC. Therefore, the answer is:\n",

However, he hopes to find a balance between factoring in these elements and leaving them out unless they impact his particular experience. In the end, he suggests that if you can take the game's flaws and remember to do better in your own life, there is an amazing game here that you can be glad you experienced.\n",
    "\n",
    "NA\n",
    "##### Price\n",
